[INSTRUCTIONS FOR VPS CODING AGENT]

SUBJECT: Enable Continuous Real-Time Chart Broadcasting (24/7)
SEVERITY: Low (Feature Request)
TARGET FILE: dashboard.py

CONTEXT:
The Ghost Mobile App v2.12 now supports a real-time chart that is always visible.
Currently, the bot only broadcasts chart data when a trade is active.
We need to change this to broadcast *always* (or at least whenever market data is refreshed).

TASK:
Modify `dashboard.py` to call `uplink.broadcast_live_chart()` (or equivalent logic) continuously in the main loop, not just inside the trade logic.

INSTRUCTIONS:

1.  **Locate the Main Loop**: In `dashboard.py`, find the `update_ticker` or the main `while True` loop where `brain.analyze()` is called.
2.  **Find Chart Broadcast Logic**: Look for where `live_chart` data is constructed and sent to Firebase. It might be inside `execution_engine.py` or `dashboard.py`.
    *   *Search Hint*: Look for `"live_chart"` or `broadcast_chart`.
3.  **Refactor**:
    *   If the logic is `if active_trade: send_chart()`, REMOVE the `if`.
    *   Use `uplink.broadcast_live_chart(symbol, price, candles, trade_lines=None)`
    *   Pass `None` for `trade_lines` if no trade is active.
    *   Pass the actual `TradeLines` (Entry, SL, TP) if a trade *is* active.

IMPORTANT:
- Ensure you do not flood Firebase. Broadcasting once every 1-5 seconds is sufficient.
- If `trade_lines` are missing/None, the App will simply draw the candles without the lines (which is what we want for "No Active Trade" mode).

[EXAMPLE LOGIC PATTERN]

```python
# In dashboard.py loop:

# 1. Get Market Data
df = self.brain.get_market_data()

# 2. Prepare Data
current_price = df['close'].iloc[-1]
last_candle = { 'o': ..., 'h': ..., 'l': ..., 'c': ... }

# 3. Check Active Trade for Lines
lines = None
if self.executor.active_trade:
     lines = { 
         'entry': self.executor.active_trade['entry'],
         'sl': self.executor.active_trade['sl'],
         'tp': self.executor.active_trade['tp']
     }

# 4. BROADCAST ALWAYS
self.uplink.broadcast_chart(current_price, last_candle, lines)
```

VERIFICATION:
- Restart Bot.
- Open Mobile App.
- Verify Chart is visible immediately (candles moving).
- Verify "Waiting for Trade..." or similar is NOT blocking the view.
