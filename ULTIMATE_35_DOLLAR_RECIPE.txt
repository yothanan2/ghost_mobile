LOGIC BEHIND THE RECIPE
=================================================================

1. TARGET BREAKDOWN:
   - Daily Goal: $35
   - Strategy: 7 wins × $5 each = $35
   - Assumes: 65% Win Rate (7 wins, 3 losses)
   - Gross: $35 wins - $7.50 losses = $27.50 net
   - Buffer: Aim for 8-10 wins to hit $35+ consistently

2. RSI SETTINGS:
   - RSI 7 = Fast reaction to M1 moves
   - RSI 40 = Buy dips (oversold)
   - RSI 60 = Sell spikes (overbought)
   - Range: Wide enough to catch real moves, not noise

3. RISK PER TRADE:
   - 1% of $1,070 = $10.70 max risk
   - With 0.04 lots, 2.5 ATR SL = ~$10 risk
   - Safe and sustainable

4. PROFIT TARGETS:
   - TP: 1.5x ATR = ~$2.25 per 0.04 lot
   - But with Profit Lock at $5, most wins = $5
   - 7 × $5 = $35 target hit

5. TRADE FREQUENCY:
   - Max 15 trades/day prevents overtrading
   - 3-minute spacing prevents revenge trading
   - At 8 wins + 4 losses = 12 trades total
   - Leaves room for 3 more if needed

6. FILTERS:
   - Volatility > 1.0 = Don't trade dead markets
   - Max Spread 2.5 = Don't scalp wide spreads
   - Confidence 65% = AI must be reasonably sure
   - EMA 50 = Trend filter (buy below, sell above)

=================================================================
DAILY WORKFLOW
=================================================================

MORNING (8:00-12:00 London Open):
- Expect: 4-5 trades
- Target: $15-20 profit
- Strategy: Breakout scalps on London volatility

AFTERNOON (13:00-17:00 NY Session):
- Expect: 3-4 trades
- Target: $10-15 profit
- Strategy: Trend continuation scalps

EVENING (18:00-22:00 Asia Prep):
- Expect: 2-3 trades
- Target: $5-10 profit
- Strategy: Range-bound mean reversion

TOTAL: 9-12 trades, $30-45 profit

STOP CONDITIONS:
- If profit hits $35, reduce CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD to 0.75
  (This slows down trading to protect profits)
- If loss hits -$15, STOP trading for the day
  (Max drawdown protection)

=================================================================
INTEGRATION WITH CASH REGISTER MODE
=================================================================

This recipe REQUIRES the "check_quick_exit" logic from 
VPS_CASH_REGISTER_INSTRUCTIONS.txt.

The combination of:
- Tight TP (1.5x ATR)
- Profit Lock ($5 target)
- RSI Reversal Exit
- Time Decay (5 min cutoff)

...ensures you're ALWAYS taking $5 wins and cutting $3 losses.

Without the early exit logic, this recipe will not hit $35/day.
With the early exit logic, it becomes a cash flow machine.

=================================================================
EXPECTED PERFORMANCE (Monthly)
=================================================================

DAILY TARGET: $35
MONTHLY (22 trading days): $35 × 22 = $770

IN THB:
$770 × 35 THB/USD = 26,950 THB/month

RETURN ON CAPITAL:
26,950 / 37,500 = 71.8% monthly return

IS THIS REALISTIC?
- If you maintain 65% win rate: YES
- If you adhere to 1% risk strictly: YES
- If you use the Cash Register exit logic: YES
- If you trade manually and get emotional: NO

This is an algorithmic target, not a discretionary one.
Trust the bot. Let it work.

=================================================================
RISK WARNING
=================================================================

71% monthly return is EXTRAORDINARY and comes with risks:

1. MARKET RISK:
   - If Gold enters a "whipsaw" phase (choppy, no trend),
     your win rate will drop to 45-50%.
   - In this case, expect $15-20/day instead of $35.

2. DRAWDOWN RISK:
   - With 1% risk, max realistic drawdown = 15%
   - That's 5,625 THB loss if you hit a bad streak
   - Psychologically, can you handle 5 straight losses?

3. OVERTRADING RISK:
   - If you remove the "MAX_TRADES_PER_DAY" limit,
     you'll overtrade and blow up.
   - Discipline is 50% of this recipe.

4. BROKER RISK:
   - If your broker widens spreads during news,
     you'll lose on slippage.
   - Stick to your 2.5 pip max spread filter.

=================================================================
OPTIMIZATION TIPS
=================================================================

AFTER 1 WEEK:
- Track actual win rate
- If > 70%, increase CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD to 0.70
  (Trade less, but higher quality)
- If < 60%, widen RSI range to 35-65
  (Catch stronger moves)

AFTER 1 MONTH:
- If consistently hitting $35+, increase DAILY_TARGET to $50
- If struggling at $25, lower to $25 and stabilize
- Compound gains: Add $10/week to capital, scale lots slowly

WHEN CAPITAL HITS $1,500:
- Increase lot size from 0.04 to 0.05
- Daily target becomes $43 (same % risk)
- Monthly becomes $946 (33,000 THB)
