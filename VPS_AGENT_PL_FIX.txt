[INSTRUCTIONS FOR VPS CODING AGENT]

SUBJECT: Fix for High Floating P/L Display on Ghost Mobile App
SEVERITY: High (User Confusion)
TARGET FILE: dashboard.py

CONTEXT:
The Ghost Mobile App v2.11 calculates Floating P/L locally using the formula: `Equity - Balance`.
However, MT5 accounts often have "Credit" (Deposit Bonus).
MT5 Formula: `Equity = Balance + Credit + Profit`.
Current Logic: `Equity - Balance = Profit + Credit`.
Result: The user sees their Credit (Bonus) significantly inflating their "Floating Profit".

TASK:
Modify the `sync_telemetry` function in `dashboard.py` to strip the Credit artifact from the P/L calculation by adding it to the reported Balance.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Open `dashboard.py`.
2. Locate the `sync_telemetry` method (approx line 993).
3. Inside the `broadcast_vitals` dictionary, find the `"balance"` key.
4. Update the value to include `getattr(info, 'credit', 0.0)`.

CODE CHANGE:

[BEFORE]
"equity": info.equity,
"balance": info.balance,
"rsi": u_rsi,

[AFTER]
"equity": info.equity,
"balance": info.balance + getattr(info, 'credit', 0.0), # [FIX] Include Credit for App P/L Calc
"rsi": u_rsi,

VERIFICATION:
- Restart the Dashboard.
- The Mobile App should now show a Floating P/L that matches the actual open trade profit, excluding the bonus credit.
